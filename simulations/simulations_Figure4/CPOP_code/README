CPOP.R -- the CPOP function. This will find the best set of changepoints.
Best is defined in terms of minimising

1/(sigma^2) sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f_i)^2+m*beta,

 where y_i are data, f_i is the fitted mean at point i; m is the number of changepoints and we consider all continuous piecewise-linear functions for f. Changepoints thus correspond to changes in slope.

The quickest version of CPOP uses C to perform the most intensive operations. The C code is in the files prune2R.c and coeff.updateR.c. These need to be compiled (to .so files) using:

R CMD SHLIB prune2R.c coeff.updateR.c

#################

estimateCPOP.R -- function to calculate the best fitting mean given a set of changepoints. Can be used to process the output of CPOP.

#################

CROPS_CPOP.R -- function to run CROPS wrapper: enables CPOP to be run for a range of penalty values (beta).

CPOPexample_functions.R -- functions used in simulation study in Maidstone et al (2017).

These functions use the l1tf package, available from:

CPOPexamples.R -- example code for using CPOP code and for replicating results in Maidstone et al (2017).
