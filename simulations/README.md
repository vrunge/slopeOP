# SlopeOP simulations
This folder contains the necessary code to run the simulations explained in the paper "Efficient Change-in-Slope Optimal Partitioning Algorithm in a Finite-Size Parameter Space".

The folder simulations_Figure4 contains the necessary programs to run the simulations displayed in figure4.

## Prerequisites:
- R packages: _SlopeOP_,  _not_ (from CRAN) and [l1tf](https://github.com/hadley/l1tf)
- compile CPOP with `make` in the CPOP subfolder
