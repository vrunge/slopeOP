Description: Optimal partitioning algorithm for change-in-slope problem with continuity constraint and a finite number of states. One can also add some constraints in the inference: isotonic, unimodal or smoothing. With the function slopeSN (segment neighborhood) the number of segments to infer is fixed by the user and do not depend on a penalty value.
