# SlopeOP simulations
This folder contains the necessary code to run the simulations explained in the paper "Efficient Change-in-Slope Optimal Partitioning Algorithm in a Finite-Size Parameter Space".

The main simulation code is contained in the Jupyter-lab nootebok **Slopeop-simulations.ipynb**, in order to open it you must have python3 and jupyter-lab installed on you system.

The simulated data is stored in the archive **SlopeOP_simulations_data.7z**. It must be archived in order to run the simulation analysis.
